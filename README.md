# Convert from any base to any other base

This app lets you convert from any valid number system to any other valid number system.

**Please understand the following constraints.**

* *A base must be greater than 1 and less than 37, since there are 10 digits plus 26 letters*
* *Your input may only include characters that are in your chosen starting base*

Here is what the app looks like:

<p float="left">
  <img src="/initial.jpg" width="40%" />
  <img src="/result.jpg" width="40%" />
</p>
